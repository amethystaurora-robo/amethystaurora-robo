## **Environmental Modelling + Bioinformatics Projects**  

### Computational Modelling Pipeline for Omics Data  
<p align="left">

</p>

This complete bioinformatics pipeline integrates traditional statistical analysis and cutting-edge graph machine learning to analyse transcriptomic and metabolomic samples of *Daphnia magna*. The organism in this pipeline has been treated with ethoprophos, an organophosphate pesticide, but the pipeline could be applied to any transcriptomic and metabolomic sample datasets.

### Environmental Biodiversity Loss Models  
<p align="left">

</p>

This project involved an analysis of fish populations vs. chemical concentrations in waterways in the UK. The outputs of this project were:
- the successful identification of 5 pesticides extant in UK waterways which may be driving biodiversity loss using a novel machine learning algorithm. 
- the deployment of an interactive map, allowing the user to explore chemicals in UK waterways over time
- an academic poster, which I presented at the Partnership for the Assessment of Risks (PARC) UK Day in May 2024, and the Centre for Environmental Research and Justice (CERJ) Conference, in June 2024.

### Application Deployment for Environmental Modelling
As a Research Assistant, I was involved in modified code for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. These simulations are used to model and improve indoor air quality. For my contribution to the project, I successfully designed and deployed a desktop application, which automates the creation of inputs for the CFD simulator.

## Just for Fun

## Part 1

In a lot of languages, the word for crow and raven are the same. In English, the word 'crow' tends to be associated with a pest, or at the least common, ordinary bird. But I took a look at a phylogenetic tree and ravens are not really clustered in one area of the branchings. It made me wonder, what are the common physical differences people associate with ravens vs crows, and is there actually a difference?

## Part 2

I've been developing a 20 questions game since I first learned how to code. I finally finished the front-end for it, and it's now live! Play below.

## Part 3

This wasn't exactly 'for fun' but I did some analysis as part of a PhD interview I had on climate tipping points. See more below.
