- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amethystaurora-robo
- ðŸŽ“ MSc in **Bioinformatics**, exploring a future in **machine learning** for impacts on health, environment, and toxicology.
- ðŸŒ± Future goal: Develop **machine learning algorithms** and create a **digital twin** for in-silico toxicity testing.
- ðŸ§¬ Past projects:
  - Developed a desktop application for the automation of input files in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
  - Developed a novel **bioinformatics pipeline** combining statistical analysis and machine learning for **temporal analysis** of the **Daphnia magna** transcriptome.
  - Conducted spatiotemporal analysis of **pesticide concentrations** and **fish populations** in UK waterways, and used cutting-edge ML algorithms for predicting biodiversity loss.
